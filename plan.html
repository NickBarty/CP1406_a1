CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan
<br>
<br>
Name: Nicholas Barty
<br>
<br>
Goal:
The volleyball website goal is to increase the companies customer base by at least 50%. The site is needed to increase
the number of potential customers the company serves each week so that they can improve their business. Expanding the
company via the web will result in more customers, allowing the client to be rewarded with more revenue than what they
were gaining before they had a website.
<br>
<br>
Success Evaluation:
The success will be determined by how many more/new people turn up to play volleyball. If the goal of at least 50% more
people turning up than before the website was implemented, (average 150 customers per week instead of 100) then the
website can be deemed a success for achieving the goal it set out to fulfill.
<br>
<br>
Target Audience:
The target audience of the website are young adults, aged 15-30. The website will target young adults by being designed
with simplicity in mind, with the main focus being to make the usability of the website as high as possible by using
easy to understand design; such as clear and concise navigation as well as easy to read content. This style will be used
throughout the entire website to keep the design consistent, easy to learn and easy to use.
